# nodejs-repo

## Project Description

This project is a simple Node.js application that demonstrates basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The purpose of this project is to provide a basic understanding of how to create and test functions in Node.js.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/8harath/nodejs-repo.git
   cd nodejs-repo
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```sh
   node app.js
   ```

## Issues Identified and Solutions Implemented

### Issue 1: Missing Multiplication and Division Functions
- **Problem**: The initial implementation only included addition and subtraction functions.
- **Solution**: Added new functions to multiply and divide two numbers.

### Issue 2: Lack of Comments
- **Problem**: The code lacked comments explaining the purpose of each function.
- **Solution**: Added comments to each function in `app.js` to explain their purpose.

### Issue 3: Incomplete Test Coverage
- **Problem**: The initial tests only covered addition and subtraction.
- **Solution**: Added tests for the new multiplication and division functions in `app.test.js`.

## Running Tests and Building the Project

1. To run the tests:
   ```sh
   npm test
   ```

2. To build the project:
   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```
